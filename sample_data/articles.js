      "Upon attending his first lecture at university, Jack meets her again. She's there in all her glory, strolling into his lecture, asking for and then insulting his name once again. The gears of life begin to turn once more for Jack - except even now, he can't find himself.\nIt seems that everyone is finding their place except for Jack.\nForever lost, unknown to himself - but not to others.",

      "When the door to the lecture hall opens two minutes before class starts, Jack Vessalius expects it to be the lecturer, but clearly, he expected too much of Rufus Barma, even in this world; there’s no world in which Rufus Barma is married to the love of his life and makes it to the first class of the year for the new students on time.\n Apparently, though, there’s a world in which the one pushing open the door is a girl he knows all too well, dressed in a white dress much the same way as she was back then, though this time with dark red tights and a cardigan the same colour thrown over her narrow shoulders to protect her from the autumn wind."+
      "\nBecause this time around it’s not snowing yet.\nHer hair is shorter, just reaching her shoulder blades instead of her lower back, the same glossy shine to its pitch black. Her eyes are red again, but this time around, that doesn’t mean anything anymore."+
      "\nThe times have changed. But Jack hasn’t.\nIn that moment, he knows even less what to feel from usually. His heart starts beating out of his chest and he feels himself start sweating, his entire body running hot, but physical reactions is everything he has to go by to judge his own emotions, all muddled deep inside of him, not much different from back then.\n"+
      "Is it infatuation? Hate? Love? Anger? Sadness? Happines?\nIf only he knew.\nHe thought that he must hold all these emotions towards her; infatuation because she cared, hate because she made him care. Love because she was everything he could have ever wanted – anger because he knew that he couldn’t have her, because everything he ever wanted would be more than he could physically tolerate. Sadness because she died. Happiness because she’s all the way back here."+
      "\nShe looks around the lecture hall, a small smile on her face, pulling her lips together in what seems like a soundless whistle. He wonders if it’s ‘Lacie’ that she’s humming in her mind. Wonders if her voice sounds the exact same as it did back then, on that snowy day, thick flakes falling onto him and the thin, rough blanket he was holding onto for even just an ounce of warmth as if that could in any way help him."+
      "\nWhen all the warmth he needed appeared right in front of him. All the warmth that made him want to live."+
      "\nAll the warmth that forced him to live against his own will."+
      "\nHe watches her and she keeps looking at the full rows, eventually spotting-"+
      "\nHim."+
      "\nJack freezes in his seat and heats up all the same."+
      "\nShe’s looking at him so thoroughly, eyes the same kind of bright. She shoulders her small tote bag (a John Tenniel illustration of the white rabbit looking at its watch in a tweed suit plastered on the front) and makes her way up the broad steps towards him."
      +
      "\nFor a moment, Jack considers running away, because so far, running is all he’s done with his life. Well. Tried to do. His family pulled him back and made him stay every single time. He doesn’t know whether he loves or hates it, but it’s not like that matters – because either way, he doesn’t deserve it. Not after the things he’s done to these people in his past life, anyways. One of them, he’s made sure couldn’t get with the love of her life back then, be it unintentional or not, it was still his fault. The other one he almost killed and then left to die for someone else to finish the dirty work, but he would’ve died just because of Jack, anyways. The other, he tortured, made him kill and cry and blamed him for all the things he and Lacie had done."
      +
      "\n“Hi! Is this seat still free?” she asks, pointing at the seat next to him, no one between him and the next person over."
      +
      "\n“Uh… yeah,” he says, knowing that he probably doesn’t sound very intelligent right now; but that’s not his concern right now. What he’s concerned about is running all the possibilities through his head."
      +
      "\nDoes she know?"
      +
      "\nDoes she remember?"
      +
      "\nHe knows his family doesn’t remember. If they do, they hide it well, but there’s no way they do – they wouldn’t treat him this well if they did."
      +
      "\nDoes she remember but thinks he doesn’t, so she’s playing dumb?"
      +
      "\nIf Lacie was anyone else, he’d know, but this is Lacie; fleeting, cold, warm, unpredictable Lacie."
      +
      "\nShe’s back."
      +
      "\nRight in front of him."
      +
      "\nHis heart is beating so loudly, pumping all the blood into his ears until he can barely hear anything but its rushing sound reverberating through his skull."
      +
      "\n“Well? Could you move over, or do you want me to take the seat, so you’d still have to stand up?”"
      +
      "\nShe’s just as direct, but her smile lets him know that she’s not annoyed. He thinks. It’s hard to tell with her, but Lacie isn’t a person to easily get annoyed with things."+
      +
      "\n“…I’ll move over,” he says, and as soon as he does so, he realizes how wrong that decision is; however, it’s too late to say so now as his body is already moving. Next thing he knows, he’s trapped between some guy who looks way too young to be sitting here, and Lacie on the other side.",
